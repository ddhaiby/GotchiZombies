## _Launch the game_

- Clone the repository https://github.com/ddhaiby/GotchiZombies
- Make sure you are up-to-date with master branch

- Open a console in the root folder. One of the quickest way is to write _cmd_ in the path text box.

In this console, write then run _npm i_ and wait for the initialisation of the game. This will install everything you need to run the game. You won't need to do that again.

##### IV) Run the game
Once the initialization is done, write and run _npm run start_. Use the localhost link given in the console in a browser to see the game. The link is usually _http://localhost:1234/_.
